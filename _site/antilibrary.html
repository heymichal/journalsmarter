It certainly happens to me (sad trombone).</p><p>How to cherry pick what‚Äôs most relevant for you right now?</p><p>This year, Silvia and I decided to experiment with <strong>mindful content consumption</strong> and we created our own <em>antilibrary</em>.</p><h2 id="antilibrary-is-environment-design">Antilibrary is Environment Design</h2><p>The basic idea behind an antilibrary is to <strong>focus on collecting what you want to learn, instead of what you already know.</strong> While it was first introduced in <em target="_blank"><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5979/9780141034591">The Black Swan</a></em> (affiliate link) as a collection of unread books, you can apply it to any form of content.</p><p>In fact, you can think about an antilibrary as an example of environment design:</p><p><strong>Whatever content you surround yourself with (be it books, videos, or conversations with people) will shape the person you become</strong>.</p><p>And since your time is limited, it‚Äôs important to choose wisely.</p><p>One of the possible solutions is to <strong>carefully examine what you want to be learning and why, and adjust your content consumption environment to become deliberate rather than random.</strong></p><p>For example, if your main passions in life are meditation, permaculture, and cycling, you might place your favourite meditation app on the homescreen of your phone (and remove everything else), buy a few books about permaculture and place them where you can see them often, and subscribe to your favourite cycling Youtube channel for a regular motivation boost. And gradually limit your engagement with other content (especially the kind that sends you down rabbit holes you don‚Äôt want to explore).</p><p>Of course, the example above is an oversimplification for most of us. After all, there are so many enriching things we could learn and it‚Äôs hard to know in advance what‚Äôs the real value of the content you‚Äôre about to engage with.</p><p>What seems to work best for me is a <strong>balancing act between deliberate learning (‚Äúexploiting‚Äù) and curiosity (‚Äúexploring‚Äù)</strong>.</p><p><em>Note: We created a journaling exercise to help you use the Explore / Exploit Trade-Off. You can find it <a href="/journaling-exercises-behavior-change/#explore-exploit-trade-off" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p><p>Let‚Äôs put this into practice:</p><p>Make it a part of your content consumption routine to ask yourself:</p><p><em><strong>Why do I want to consume this content?</strong></em></p><p>The answers can reveal some uncomfortable truths, such as:</p><p>‚ÄúI never actually read this newsletter, but staying subscribed makes me feel clever.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to consume whatever Netflix recommends than find a good film to watch.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI bought this book because I‚Äôm addicted to collecting books, but the truth is that I‚Äôll probably never read it.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm reading this‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>These insights are precious.¬†You can use them to optimize your environment for deliberate content consumption, one step at a time.</p><p>And if you‚Äôre curious about my personal insights and actions from this process, then here they are:</p><ul><li>Switch off auto-play in everything.</li><li>Reach out to people I trust to know about a topics I want to learn about and ask for content recommendations, rather than click on interesting links on social feeds.</li><li>Prioritize long-form text, such as books and essays, over short articles.</li><li>Send all articles and videos I feel like consuming to <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>. Ask myself:¬†<em>‚Äúwhat do I want to learn about?‚Äù</em> before opening Instapaper.</li><li>Keep unsubscribing from all newsletters that are not relevant for me right now. I can always find the content on the website if I feel like it.</li></ul><p>But here‚Äôs the hard truth:</p><p>Even if you narrow your interests down, there‚Äôs still an <em>infinite</em> amount of content you could be consuming.</p><p>That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve taken another step.</p><h2 id="the-minimalist-bookshelf">The Minimalist Bookshelf</h2><p>Imagine that you‚Äôre about to spend a month crossing an ocean on a sailboat. What content would you take with you?</p><p>After coming across the <em>Pino Bookclub</em> from <a href="https://100r.co/site/library.html" target="_blank">100 Rabbits</a> (a couple of creators living on a sailboat), Silvia and I decided to apply a similar tactic and <strong>deliberately choose books we want to read this year, order them in print, and place them on a bookshelf in a place where we can see them very often.</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/bookshelf-2021.jpg" alt="My Bookshelf" /></p><p><em>Fun fact: I built the bookshelf myself from recycled pallets.</em></p><p>We didn‚Äôt set a specific number of books in advance, but tried to keep the selection relatively small ‚Äî¬†just enough to bring variety and insight, but not too much to trigger overwhelm and getting lost.</p><p>We also spent some time choosing the books together, which made it easy to act intentionally, rather than on impulse. And having the two of us became an asset: Silvia chose books that I wouldn‚Äôt, and vice-versa, which brings an extra degree of ‚Äúexploring‚Äù into the mix.</p><p>Finally, we picked the place for the bookself strategically. We spend a lot of time in the office (which is also our playroom), and having the books at the entrance ensures that we keep seeing them throughout the day, so they stay in our awareness. That‚Äôs also one of the reasons why we decided to go for physical books, rather than ebooks.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the magic formula:</p><p><strong>Deliberate content consumption (why?) + radical prioritization (less is more).</strong></p><p>And now, to the actual books we picked.</p><h2 id="our-bookshelf-for-2021">Our Bookshelf for 2021</h2><p>We divided the books in two categories:</p><ol><li><strong>Manuals</strong>:¬†books that provide deep insight into a specific topic/area that we want to be coming back to regularly for reference.</li><li><strong>‚ÄúSingle-read books‚Äù</strong>:¬†other books, mostly to be read once.</li></ol><p>You‚Äôll notice that we didn‚Äôt pick many fiction books, and that‚Äôs deliberate. We are lucky to have a local library full of amazing literature curated by two book lovers, and we prefer to chose fiction reads based on curiosity, rather than planning.</p><p>We also didn‚Äôt decide what we‚Äôll do with the single-reads at the end of the year, but that‚Äôs a problem for our future-selves. We might donate them to the library, or share them with our friends / community.</p><p>Here are the books in no particular order, along with a short explanation of why we picked them.</p><p>You can watch the video, or if you prefer, read below.</p><p>FYI: All links are affiliate links.</p><h3 id="manuals">Manuals</h3><h4 id="the-tibetan-book-of-living-and-dying-by-sogyal-rinpoche"><em>The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</em> by Sogyal Rinpoche</h4><p>Because inevitably I will die, and I want to be ready when I do.
