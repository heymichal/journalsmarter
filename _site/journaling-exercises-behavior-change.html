The basic concept is to use the <strong>four elements as a framework to help us achieve balance</strong>. Here’s a version that can be applied to our modern, busy lives:</p><ul><li>Fire = Power / Action; (excess = Burnout);</li><li>Water = Emotions / Subconscious; (excess = Overwhelm);</li><li>Earth = Structure / Grounding; (excess = Feeling stuck);</li><li>Air = Wisdom / Consciousness, (excess = Overthinking).</li></ul><p>How can you use it?</p><p>When feeling out of balance, see which quadrant of the Medicine Wheel is in excess and <strong>engage in activities that belong to the diagonally inverse quadrant</strong>.

It turns out it’s not one big decisive moment that determines greatness: <strong>it is a series of interlinked events that trigger each other to make success inevitable</strong>—a metaphoric <em>‘flywheel’</em>.</p><p>Jim Collins calls it <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/the-flywheel-effect.html" target="_blank">‘The Flywheel Effect’</a>, and it can be applied both to business and personal life. In his <a href="https://tim.blog/2019/02/18/jim-collins/" target="_blank">interview with Tim Ferris</a>, he gives the example of his own personal flywheel:</p><p><em>Curiosity for big questions &gt; research &gt; good ideas &gt; books and teaching &gt; impact &gt; fund access &gt; curiosity &gt;…</em></p><p>As in:</p><p><em>Curiosity for big questions inevitably leads to him engaging in research, which is bound to produce (at least a few) very good ideas. Those are naturally destined to lead towards writing and teaching, which is likely to have impact on the world, consequently leading towards accessing funds, allowing to fund another project, and thus completing the loop.</em></p><p><strong>A flywheel builds a compounding momentum over time with each loop adding up to the cumulative effect.</strong> If you do “a”, you can’t help but do “b”. If you do “b”, you can’t help but do “c”—and so on. It requires constant optimization, but it can be maintained and repeated for decades.</p><p>You can <strong>use the spread above to brainstorm the activities that, brought together in a sequential way, inevitably lead you towards greatness and success.</strong></p><p>However, this is just a very basic explanation of ‘The Flywheel Effect’; if you want to learn in depth about it and build your own powerful flywheel, read Jim Collins’s book ‘<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ly2Lbo" target="_blank">Turning the Flywheel</a>’</p><h3 id="8high-impact-actions">8. <strong>High Impact Actions</strong></h3><p>Source: Rafael Sarandeses</p><p><em>Engage in actions that are most likely to bring you the desired result.</em></p><p><a href="https://journalsmarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8-hia.jpg"><img src="https://journalsmarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8-hia.jpg" alt="high impact actions journaling exercise" /></a></p><p>Knowing your goal is not enough.

In his article <a href="https://joshkaufman.net/explore-exploit/" target="_blank">‘Explore/Exploit’</a>, Josh Kaufman offers a very clear explanation of the pros and cons of exploring versus exploiting while working on a project or trying to achieve a goal.</p><p>So how does this principle work?</p><p>To find the best path towards your goals, you need to experiment with different options—you need to test, and be aware of other possibly more effective routes. However, every new <em>exploratio_n has an opportunity cost: _less time to exploit</em> the current option.</p><p><em>Exploring only</em> leads to collecting a lot of information, but not making sufficient progress on any of the available paths. In contrast, <em>exploiting only</em> risks missing out on better solutions.</p><p>For example, if you started a new diet a few weeks ago but still see no results in terms of weight loss, you might want to try a new one. However, by doing so you might be giving up too early to see results—not <em>exploiting</em> the current enough to realize it’s actually ideal for you in the long run. But what if this is not the ideal diet for you? How to solve this dilemma?</p><p>Effective strategies include a combination of exploring and exploiting in various proportions. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><em>‘Epsilon-first’</em> strategy: Explore first, then exploit the best outcome;</li><li><em>‘Epsilon-greedy’</em> strategy: Pick the best currently available option between exploiting and exploring;</li><li>Minimize expected successes lost (e.g. when facing ethical constraints);</li><li>Establish a price for each option (e.g. sum of expected reward + estimated future reward);</li></ul><p>What projects are you currently working on? What’s the best strategy for each of them?

They are generally easy to build using an external trigger (e.g. alarm) as a reminder for the desired behavior.</p><p><strong>Expert behaviors</strong> require a high degree of self-control and mastery and are common across experts in various disciplines (from professional sports to science). They generally require long periods of diligent practice (e.g. performing a neurosurgery).</p><p><strong>Addictive behaviors</strong> require a significant amount of willpower to break, as neural loops drive the addict to prioritize satisfying their urge over long-term wellbeing. They require drastic measures, such as abstinence, change of environment and involved support from others.</p><p><strong>Habitué behaviors</strong> are generally relatively easy to resist (e.g. having that amazing chocolate cake). The techniques build equanimity to face the discomfort arising from not fulfilling the desire.</p><p>Ask yourself: <em>“Which behaviors do I want to quit/form?”,</em> and place them into their appropriate category in the matrix.</p><p>Then, to learn how to tackle each of them, read Nir’s article <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-design-behavior/"><em>‘How to Design Behavior (The Behavior Change Matrix)’</em></a>, which will show you different strategies to tackle each specific behavior.</p><h2 id="vi-become-a-communication-master-grow-your-network-and-build-awesome-relationships">VI.

For example, if you lack confidence, you might turn your shoulders down, speak slowly and quietly, and breathe in a shallow way.</p><p>However, the opposite is also true: <strong>you can use your posture to change your mood</strong>. If you open up your chest, breathe in deeply, and speak clearly and enthusiastically, this can radically change the way you feel.</p><p>This principle is often applied and taught by Tony Robbins, who jumps on a tiny trampoline before he goes on stage to change his mood, and jumps into a cold water tank every morning to raise his energy. He offers some techniques to change your mood in his article ‘<a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/mind-meaning/how-to-reset-your-mind-and-mood/">How to Reset Your Mind and Mood</a>’.</p><p>Think about ways in which you can move your body in order to change the way you feel.
