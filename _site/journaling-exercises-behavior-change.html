In his <a href="https://tim.blog/2019/02/18/jim-collins/" target="_blank">interview with Tim Ferris</a>, he gives the example of his own personal flywheel:</p><p><em>Curiosity for big questions &gt; research &gt; good ideas &gt; books and teaching &gt; impact &gt; fund access &gt; curiosity &gt;‚Ä¶</em></p><p>As in:</p><p><em>Curiosity for big questions inevitably leads to him engaging in research, which is bound to produce (at least a few) very good ideas.

In his article <a href="https://joshkaufman.net/explore-exploit/" target="_blank">‚ÄòExplore/Exploit‚Äô</a>, Josh Kaufman offers a very clear explanation of the pros and cons of exploring versus exploiting while working on a project or trying to achieve a goal.</p><p>So how does this principle work?</p><p>To find the best path towards your goals, you need to experiment with different options‚Äîyou need to test, and be aware of other possibly more effective routes. However, every new <em>exploratio_n has an opportunity cost: _less time to exploit</em> the current option.</p><p><em>Exploring only</em> leads to collecting a lot of information, but not making sufficient progress on any of the available paths. In contrast, <em>exploiting only</em> risks missing out on better solutions.</p><p>For example, if you started a new diet a few weeks ago but still see no results in terms of weight loss, you might want to try a new one. However, by doing so you might be giving up too early to see results‚Äînot <em>exploiting</em> the current enough to realize it‚Äôs actually ideal for you in the long run. But what if this is not the ideal diet for you? How to solve this dilemma?</p><p>Effective strategies include a combination of exploring and exploiting in various proportions. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><em>‚ÄòEpsilon-first‚Äô</em> strategy: Explore first, then exploit the best outcome;</li><li><em>‚ÄòEpsilon-greedy‚Äô</em> strategy: Pick the best currently available option between exploiting and exploring;</li><li>Minimize expected successes lost (e.g. when facing ethical constraints);</li><li>Establish a price for each option (e.g. sum of expected reward + estimated future reward);</li></ul><p>What projects are you currently working on? What‚Äôs the best strategy for each of them?
