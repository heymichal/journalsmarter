We’re Michal and Silvia and we developed the Minimalist Weekly Review practice over almost 200 (and counting) weekly reviews.</p><p>After experimenting with different productivity tools, principles, and techniques to bring more structure and effectiveness to our personal and professional lives, <strong>we have distilled the most powerful elements and turned them into a powerful 15-minute weekly review practice that has radically increased our productivity, clarity, and prioritizing skills.</strong></p><p><img src="https://journalsmarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/experiments-with-weekly-review.png" alt="" /></p><p>We know that starting a new practice can be hard, no matter how beneficial you know it to be.. That’s why we kept it <em>minimalist</em>: the review includes no unnecessary “fluff”, only what is required to achieve amazing results, without it becoming a huge hassle.</p><p>In other words, <strong>it’s so easy to start that you will be able to actually do it</strong> <strong><em>immediately,</em></strong> <strong>and then keep it up for the weeks to come.
