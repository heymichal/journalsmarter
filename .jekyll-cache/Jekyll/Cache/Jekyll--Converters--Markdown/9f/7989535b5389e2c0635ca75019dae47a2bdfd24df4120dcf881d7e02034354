  <p><em>‚ÄúQuality questions create a quality life. Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.‚Äù</em> ‚Äì Tony Robbins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of your life is directly connected to the questions you are willing to ask.</p>

<p><strong>Better questions lead to better answers. Better answers lead to better actions. Better actions lead to better outcomes.</strong></p>

<p>The thing is:</p>

<p>We all ask questions to other people pretty much every single day, but how often do we take the time to look within and <em>ask ourselves</em>?</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a simple way to do it, and the name of this blog probably gave you quite a good hint on what it might be.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre right! It‚Äôs journaling.</p>

<p>The selection below includes some of my favorite questions for getting to know myself (although you can also ask them to other people). Simply pick the one(s) that resonate with you and answer them in your journal. Profound insights guaranteed.</p>

<p><em>Note: If you want to learn how to incorporate questions into a powerful journaling practice, <a href="/journal-writing/" target="_blank">here‚Äôs an article to read</a>.</em></p>
