I"Ω<p><strong>Gratitude Mandala is a journaling game for one player, with the goal of tuning into loving-kindness and expressing gratitude to your most important people.</strong></p>

<p>Gratitude Mandala is a part of my yearly review process since 2019, however you can engage in it at any point. Simply adjust the timeframe and the guiding questions.</p>

<p>Of course, you don‚Äôt really <em>need</em> a mandala. You can make a simple list instead. With that in mind, drawing a mandala is a wonderful meditative drawing practice and it always brings me into a more connected state.</p>

<p>If you never drew a mandala before, Silvia wrote <a href="/meditative-drawing/#5_Drawing_Mandalas">this instructions</a> that you might find handy.</p>

<p>Prep:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Journal or piece of paper</li>
  <li>compass (for drawing circles) - helpful for drawing the mandala, but not necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if you‚Äôre conducting this game as a part of your yearly review, it‚Äôs quite likely that there are a lot of people you will be grateful for. It might be useful to first make a list.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a mandala in your journal. Make sure to leave a lot of empty space.</li>
  <li>(Optional, but recommended) Meditate for a few minutes. Think of the people / beings (eg. animals) that you‚Äôre the most grateful for in the timeframe you picked (eg. your year, or simply ‚Äúright now‚Äù).</li>
  <li>Write down the names of people / beings inside your mandala.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can either end here, or proceed to the next step. It‚Äôs the most exciting one, but also demands more time and energy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a letter / message to people inside your Gratitude Mandala. Of course, you don‚Äôt need to write to every single person individually. Pick the most important people and / or group people into relevant ‚Äúcategories‚Äù and write to multiple people at once.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy the heartfelt connections!</p>

<p>Note: In 202</p>
