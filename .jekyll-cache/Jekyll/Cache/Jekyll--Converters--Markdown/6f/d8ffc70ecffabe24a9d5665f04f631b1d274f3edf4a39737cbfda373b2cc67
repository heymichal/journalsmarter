I")<p><strong>Gratitude Mandala is a journaling game for one player, with the goal of tuning into loving-kindness and expressing gratitude to your most important people.</strong></p>

<p>Gratitude Mandala is a part of my yearly review process since 2019, however you can engage in it at any point. Simply adjust the timeframe and the guiding questions.</p>

<p>Of course, you don’t really <em>need</em> a mandala. You can make a simple list instead. With that in mind, drawing a mandala is a wonderful meditative drawing practice and it always brings me into a more connected state.</p>

<p>If you never drew a mandala before, Silvia wrote <a href="/meditative-drawing/#5_Drawing_Mandalas">this instructions</a> that you might find handy.</p>

<p>Prep:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Journal or piece of paper</li>
  <li>compass (for drawing circles) - helpful for drawing the mandala, but not necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if y</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a mandala in your journal. Make sure to leave a lot of empty space.</li>
  <li>(Optional, but recommended) Meditate for a few minutes. Think of the people / beings (eg. animals) that you’re the most grateful for in the timeframe you picked (eg. your year, or simply “right now”).</li>
  <li>Write down the names of people / beings inside your mandala.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a practice I started to experiment with two years ago. During the yearly review process, I draw a mandala with a lot of empty space inside. I then fill the space with names of people I feel particularly grateful for in that year.</p>

<p>I’ve been recently reconnecting with my letter writing practice, which feels like a perfect addition to the gratitude mandala. A technical problem is that there’s probably at least a hundred of people that I’d like to hug this year, and while I love the idea of writing a letter to each of them, I admit that it’s unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>I’m thinking of writing a few individual letters, as well as writing one (or more) letters addressed to groups of people. It’s not as personal, but it can be as heartfelt and touching. I’ll use a combination of traditional hand-written letters and electronic tools, such as emails and posts on my <a href="https://michalkorzonek.com/tag/letters/">personal website</a>, which has some letters already)</p>
