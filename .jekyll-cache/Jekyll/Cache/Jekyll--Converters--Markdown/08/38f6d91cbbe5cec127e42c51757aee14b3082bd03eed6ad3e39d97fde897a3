I"…<p>I‚Äôve started experimenting with this practice two years ago during my yearly review. I found it to be a powerful way to tune myself into loving-kindness energy, as well as prompt myself to express gratitude to my most important people.</p>

<p><strong>Dream Nursery is a journaling game for one player, with the goal of deliberately choosing dreams to ‚Äúplant‚Äù in a nursery, and then watch them grow or not through a defined time horizon.</strong></p>

<p>This is a practice I started to experiment with two years ago. During the yearly review process, I draw a mandala with a lot of empty space inside. I then fill the space with names of people I feel particularly grateful for in that year.</p>

<p>Of course, you don‚Äôt really <em>need</em> a mandala. You can make a simple list instead. With that in mind, drawing a mandala is a wonderful meditative drawing practice and it always brings me into a more connected state.</p>

<p>If you never drew a mandala before, Silvia wrote <a href="https://journalsmarter.com/meditative-drawing/#5_Drawing_Mandalas">this instructions</a> that you might find handy.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been recently reconnecting with my letter writing practice, which feels like a perfect addition to the gratitude mandala. A technical problem is that there‚Äôs probably at least a hundred of people that I‚Äôd like to hug this year, and while I love the idea of writing a letter to each of them, I admit that it‚Äôs unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm thinking of writing a few individual letters, as well as writing one (or more) letters addressed to groups of people. It‚Äôs not as personal, but it can be as heartfelt and touching. I‚Äôll use a combination of traditional hand-written letters and electronic tools, such as emails and posts on my <a href="https://michalkorzonek.com/tag/letters/">personal website</a>, which has some letters already)</p>
