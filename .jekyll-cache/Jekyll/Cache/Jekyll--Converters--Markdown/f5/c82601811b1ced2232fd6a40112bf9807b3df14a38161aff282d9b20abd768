<p>Over the last few months I’ve been experiencing an explosion of vitality, creativity and abundance. But everything in nature moves towards balance, so while I wasn’t looking forward to the change of energy, I knew it would have to happen, sooner or later.</p>

<p>And one day, without any notice, it did.</p>

<p>For the last few days, I felt very low on spirit. I kept observing myself binge on apples, chocolate, and neo-noir cinema. My work just wasn’t flowing. I didn’t feel particularly <em>bad</em> but just didn’t feel like doing anything.</p>

<p>Today is the first day that I woke up full of energy. I took some time to clean and organise my tiny house, which became a total mess, and took my thoughts for a long walk in the forest. It was all I needed.</p>

<p>As I was filling my daily <a href="https://infinitysquares.xyz" target="_blank">Infinity Square</a>, I felt a sudden spark of insight and drew this in my journal:</p>

<p>This was definitely not the first time that I went through this pattern.</p>

<p>Here’s what happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Something at work is not flowing, and I can’t let go of trying to “fix it”.</li>
  <li>As I keep pushing through, my house becomes a disaster.</li>
  <li>I can’t focus or reach clarity in a messy environment.</li>
  <li>Without focus and clarity, I can’t fix the problem I’m working on.</li>
</ol>

<p>The vicious cycle continues…</p>

<p>Until.</p>

<p>One day I break free.</p>

<p>I can distill it into three ideas:</p>

<p><strong>1) Any pattern can be reversed.</strong><br />
<strong>2) Reversing a pattern starts with being aware.</strong><br />
<strong>3) Journaling makes me aware.</strong><br /></p>

<p>This is why I journal every single day.</p>

<p>Even if I’m feeling extremely low, I still open a page with squares for the current Moon Cycle and fill the one that represents my current day in any way I want to. It takes ten seconds, so I feel no resistance to do it. Over 14000 days I haven’t skipped a square.</p>

<p>But the magic doesn’t happen in the square only.</p>

<p><strong>The square is a quick self-aligning ritual, an equivalent to a short meditation. As I reconnect with myself, even if it’s for a tiny moment, I might notice <em>something</em>, which might prompt me to take the next step: open my journal on the first available page and go deeper.</strong></p>

<p>The square is a gateway into my journal.</p>

<p>My journal is a gateway into myself.</p>
