I"1<p><strong>Dream Nursery is a journaling game for one player, with the goal of deliberately choosing dreams to ‚Äúplant‚Äù in a nursery, and then watch them grow or not through a defined time horizon.</strong></p>

<p>The time horizon can be adjusted to fit the player(s) context. For example, a player can create a poster-like page for during their yearly-review to serve for the <em>entire year</em>. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a player might set up a <a href="/brain-dump">braindump</a>-like page to relieve their heads from ideas, and then choose on one (or more) for <em>immediate execution</em>.</p>

<p>The game can also be played relationally, for example using simple format: checkin / game / sharing / checkout.</p>

<p>Prep:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pen and paper (or digital file)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This was my very first attempt at building a nursery for plants to germinate. It didn‚Äôt seem very stable, but it survived a winter storm and as far as I am aware is still standing strong on it‚Äôs feet, nurturing another generation of plants üå±.</em></p>
