<p>✨<br />
Journaling achieves this in three steps:</p>

Hi, I’m Michał (Me-How), and I’ll be your host on this adventure.</p>

<p>My highly relevant superpower is being able to turn anything into a (journaling) game. My slightly less relevant superpower is walking for hours, which is usually followed by writing heartfelt letters.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to meet you.</p>

<p>💚<br />
My big dream is to live in an off-grid tiny house in the middle of an abundant food forest, and catalyse a network of regenerative projects in my bio-region and document the process. The profits from the Infinite Game of Journaling go directly towards fueling this dream. Thank you for Being!</p>
