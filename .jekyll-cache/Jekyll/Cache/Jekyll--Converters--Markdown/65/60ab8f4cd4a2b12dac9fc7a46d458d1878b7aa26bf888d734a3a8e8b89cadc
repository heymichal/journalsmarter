I"Ÿ	<p><strong>Gratitude Mandala is a journaling game for one player, with the goal of tuning into loving-kindness and expressing gratitude to your most important people.</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve started experimenting with it during my 2019 yearly review.</p>

<p>Of course, you donâ€™t really <em>need</em> a mandala. You can make a simple list instead. With that in mind, drawing a mandala is a wonderful meditative drawing practice and it always brings me into a more connected state.</p>

<p>This is a practice I started to experiment with two years ago. During the yearly review process, I draw a mandala with a lot of empty space inside. I then fill the space with names of people I feel particularly grateful for in that year.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been recently reconnecting with my letter writing practice, which feels like a perfect addition to the gratitude mandala. A technical problem is that thereâ€™s probably at least a hundred of people that Iâ€™d like to hug this year, and while I love the idea of writing a letter to each of them, I admit that itâ€™s unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m thinking of writing a few individual letters, as well as writing one (or more) letters addressed to groups of people. Itâ€™s not as personal, but it can be as heartfelt and touching. Iâ€™ll use a combination of traditional hand-written letters and electronic tools, such as emails and posts on my <a href="https://michalkorzonek.com/tag/letters/">personal website</a>, which has some letters already)</p>
