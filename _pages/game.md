The Infinite Game of Journaling encourages players to journal in order to **co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive**.

✨<br>
Journaling achieves this in three steps:

1. Journaling is a practice of **regular re-alignment**
2. Being aligned allows you to **embody your values**, no matter the challenge
3. Embodying your values allows you to **co-create a beautiful world**.

🌊.<br>
**Journaling is an *infinite game*** - the purpose is to keep playing. To keep players engaged, the Infinite Game of Journaling combines five strategies:

1. Playful Experimentation
2. Rhythms
3. Tiny Habits
4. Kind Encouragement
5. Relational Thinking

⚙️<br>
**Players get unlimited access to modular journaling guides**, which can be embarked on at any point, in any order. The guides include guided journaling sessions, games, and programs. They are suitable for paper and digital journals.

✉️<br>
**The guides are async-first**. Most are delivered via email, because we all have an account and it's easy to engage in a conversation.

The Infinite Game of Journaling includes **occasional live online events**, such as co-journaling sessions and workshops.

🌱<br>

Hi, I'm Michał (Me-How), and I'll be your host on this adventure.

My highly relevant superpower is being able to turn anything into a (journaling) game. My slightly less relevant superpower is walking for hours, which is usually followed by writing heartfelt letters.

I'm looking forward to meet you.

💚<br>
My big dream is to live in an off-grid tiny house in the middle of an abundant food forest, and catalyse a network of regenerative projects in my bio-region and document the process. The profits from the Infinite Game of Journaling go directly towards fueling this dream. Thank you for Being!
