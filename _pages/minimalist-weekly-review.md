Imagine having a week just to yourself. 

No commitments. No news. Just you in a beautiful place in nature and a lot of space to relax, breath and **reconnect with yourself and what is important to you**.

Imagine all the **overwhelm, anxiety, confusion, stress, and pressure dissolving away**, marking the new beginning and making space for everything exciting that’s still to come.

How would it feel like to have clarity on what you _really_ want to do and _why_?

What would it mean to **see the** **_exact steps_** **you need to take to achieve your goals**, outlined right in front of you?

The thing is, you don’t need to go on a retreat in the woods to connect with that feeling—**all you need is the right journaling practice and 15 minutes a week**

## The Minimalist Weekly Review: 3 Simple Steps to Stay Focused, Maintain Perspective, and Bring Yourself Back to Balance Every Week

Do you ever get lost in meaningless tasks instead of working towards your goals? Do you struggle with procrastination? Do you crave more organization, focus, and prioritizing skills in your life?

The Minimalist Weekly Review can help you get all of that by guiding you through three simple steps:

### 1. Reflect

Shift your perspective to see **the big picture of your life**, so that whatever you decide to do, no matter how small, will be a step in the right direction. Get clarity on your long-term goals. Build yourself a compass to guide you even through the thickest fog.

### 2. Review

Capture your past week **on a single page** in your journal and **process the key insights effectively**, so you can adjust your course and improve your strategy for the following week. Learn from your own experiences and give yourself a weekly fresh start, turning your life into a beautiful cycle of continuous improvement.

### 3. Plan

It’s easy to get stuck in looking for a perfect strategy but never actually start. That’s why you’ll learn how to organize your life and goals into actionable weekly cycles, which will  make your plan so **clear and obvious** that you can’t possibly fall for that trap anymore. Instead, you’ll know exactly _what_ to do and _why_ you’re doing it, so you can **prioritize well, stay focused, and avoid overcommitment**.

Boom.

15 minutes later, you’re ready to face your life again, feeling ready, relaxed, and in tune with yourself and what is important to you.
