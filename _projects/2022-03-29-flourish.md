## A Journey of Reconnection and Abundant Growth
![A sun smiling from behind a mountain](/assets/gentle-sun.jpg)


*Flourish* is a facilitated journey into Spring - a perfect time to invite abundance!
<p>
🌱
</p>
During three group calls aligned with the Moon cycle, we'll explore powerful journaling and relational growth practices, to **reconnect with dreams, set intentions, and manifest them, from a place of balance, joy, and tranquility**.

The journey includes a private connection call with Michał (that's me 👋  ). I'm an experience designer, catalyst & certified habit coach and I will hold space for you to further **nourish the seeds of transformation you are planting, remove potential bottlenecks, and catalyse the energy to flow**.

## Testimonials
Here are a few reflections from participants of recent experiences:

> “I have learned **brilliant and simple ways to accommodate new practices in my life** without drastic and dramatic efforts, but with great impact and effect.”<br>
> -- Beatriz Fonseca; *Closer & Traditional Dream Factory*

> “I've made my year in review as always to close this year. Going through my calendar, the series of events, feelings and insights that I had, I realized how much of a great impact your work had on the positive outcome of my year. **I'm slowly changing to become the person I would like to be. You gave me tools for that, by putting your heart in sharing your own life and learnings openly, as a coach, as a mentor, as a person.**"<br>
> -- Flora Koczka; *Wise*

> “My mindfulness practice and insights are deepening. I’m learning more about how to slip from busy mind to quiet mind. **My mind is slowly becoming a quieter and more spacious place.** It’s The. Best. Practice. Ever.” <br>
> -- Deanna Vogt; *Executive Coach*

> "I was thinking this morning about the tiny habit practice and the one I chosen (feeling into my feet) has led me to really focusing on how I experience things in my body (...). The way I move, breathe, see and hear changed drastically already and it all started through realising I am feeling disconnected and need to sense into my feet. So small but so incredibly powerful. **I am beyond grateful for you all helping me realising how things can change and to what extend.**<br>
> -- Alina Manko; *Enspiral & Open Collective*

> “I am DEEPLY grateful for your program. **I am on day 140 of yoga daily and day 74 of meditating every day.** It's making such a difference in EVERYTHING.”<br>
> -- Cathy Hutchison; *Idibri & Your Visual Journal*
