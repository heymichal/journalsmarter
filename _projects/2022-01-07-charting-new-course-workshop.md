*Members: You should have received a calendar invite from me with the time and zoom link. If you haven't, just message me at hello at journalsmarter dot com, and I'll send you the details.*

The workshop includes **individual  journaling** based on three graphs / visual prompts which I'll share with you, as well as **relational thinking** where we'll help each other to refine our thinking and find more clarity. There's nothing quite like connecting and sharing, and this workshop is a safe space to do so.

If you have any questions, send me a message.

With Love, <br>
