**Gratitude Mandala is a journaling game for one player, with the goal of tuning into loving-kindness and expressing gratitude to your most important people.**

Gratitude Mandala is a part of my yearly review process since 2019, however you can engage in it at any point. Simply adjust the timeframe and the guiding questions.

Of course, you don't really *need* a mandala. You can make a simple list instead. With that in mind, drawing a mandala is a wonderful meditative drawing practice and it always brings me into a more connected state.

If you never drew a mandala before, Silvia wrote [this instructions](/meditative-drawing/#5_Drawing_Mandalas) that you might find handy.

Prep:
- Journal or piece of paper
- compass (for drawing circles) - helpful for drawing the mandala, but not necessary

Note: if you're conducting this game as a part of your yearly review, it's quite likely that there are a lot of people you will be grateful for. It might be useful to first make a list.

Instructions:
1. Draw a mandala in your journal. Make sure to leave a lot of empty space.
2. (Optional, but recommended) Meditate for a few minutes. Think of the people / beings (eg. animals) that you're the most grateful for in the timeframe you picked (eg. your year, or simply "right now").
3. Write down the names of people / beings inside your mandala.

You can either end here, or proceed to the next step. It's the most exciting one, but also demands more time and energy.

4. Write a letter / message to people inside your Gratitude Mandala. Of course, you don't need to write to every single person individually. Pick the most important people and / or group people into relevant "categories" and write to multiple people at once.

Enjoy the heartfelt connections!

Note: I'm now reconnecting with my letter-writing practice, and I've decided to publish some of my gratitude letters from 2021 mandala. I'll be adding them [here](https://michalkorzonek.com/gratitude-mandala-2021){:target="_blank"}.
